Hello, my name is Matt Latino. I am currently a fourth-year Bachelor's student at Cardiff University.

I have recently decided to actually develop my portfolio, and one of the first steps I have taken is to learn how to use Git properly.
Hopefully, this GitHub account will have plenty of interesting repositories of projects eventually.
